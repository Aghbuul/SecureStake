# SecureStake


## Introduction

I wanted to build a digital "bank" that would allow me to save money and earn interest. It seemed like an appropriate project to build on the Vyper language given its focus on security. This is my first time building a contract on Vyper, so I wanted to build a simple project, and see how far I could push Claude (by Antropic AI) with the help of the Vyper language documentation. 

I did testing of the functions on RemixIDE (which works great with Vyper!).


## Executive Summary

### Test Results Overview
The following basic functionality tests were completed:

1. Access Control Tests:
   - Basic owner permission checks
   - Basic validator permission checks
   - Simple threshold validation

2. Rate Limiting Tests:
   - Transfer amount limits enforced (min/max)
   - Double-processing prevention working
   - Double-validation prevention working

3. Emergency Controls:
   - Pause functionality working
   - Emergency scenarios handled correctly
   - Invalid inputs rejected appropriately

### Project Overview

SecureStake is a token management platform with staking and multi-signature validation capabilities:
1. **Token Staking**: Users can lock tokens in the contract and potentially earn rewards (subject to reward pool availability)
2. **Validated Transfers**: Transfers require approval from multiple authorized validators
3. **Time-Locked Operations**: Large transfers are subject to a waiting period
4. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions and emergency pause functionality

Key Security Features:
- Multi-signature requirement (minimum 2 validator approvals needed)
- Time delay for large transfers (1-hour lockup period)
- Basic rate limiting on transfer amounts
- Standard reentrancy protection
- Contract pause mechanism
- Role-based access control

Core Functions:
1. `bridge_tokens`: Initiates a validated transfer
   - Basic token and amount validation
   - Enforces transfer limits
   - Creates transfer record
   - Emits TransferInitiated event

2. `validate_transfer`: Collects validator approvals
   - Limited to authorized validators
   - Basic double-signing prevention
   - Tracks approval count
   - Emits TransferValidated event

3. `process_transfer`: Executes approved transfers
   - Verifies validator threshold
   - Checks timelock expiration
   - Basic double-processing prevention
   - Emits TransferProcessed event

4. Emergency Controls:
   - pause/unpause for emergency stops
   - Validator management functions
   - Rate limit controls

## Part 2: Basic Functionality Testing

### A. Core Function Tests

## Part 2: Testing Execution Logs

### A. Basic Functionality Testing

1. **Initial Staking Test** ✅
   Detailed Steps Executed:
   ```
   1. Open SecureStakingPool contract
   2. Find stake function
   3. Enter amount
   4. Click "transact"
   ```
   Results:
   - Status: Success
   - Event: Staked event emitted

2. **Stake Verification** ✅
   Detailed Steps Executed:
   ```
   1. Click on SecureStakingPool contract
   2. Find balances button
   3. Enter address
   4. Click the button
   5. Find total_staked button
   6. Click it
   ```
   Results:
   - Status: Verified correct

3. **Rewards Testing** ✅
   Detailed Steps Executed:
   ```
   1. Wait 5 minutes
   2. Call get_pending_reward
   3. Note reward amount
   4. Call claim_reward()
   ```
   Results:
   - Pending Rewards Check:
     - Status: Verified non-zero
   
   - Reward Claim:
     - Status: Success
     - Event: RewardClaimed event emitted

4. **Bridge Operations** ✅
   Detailed Steps Executed:
   ```
   First Transfer:
   1. Open SecureBridge contract
   2. Find bridge_tokens function
   3. Enter parameters
   4. Click "transact"
   
   Validator Steps:
   1. Switch to Validator Account 1
   2. Call validate_transfer with transfer hash
   3. Switch to Validator Account 2
   4. Call validate_transfer with same hash
   ```
   Results:
   - Bridge Initiation: Success
   - Validator 1 Signature: Success
   - Validator 2 Signature: Success
   - Processing: Success
   
   Second Transfer:
   - Bridge Initiation: Success
   - Validator 1 Signature: Success
   - Validator 2 Signature: Success
   - Processing: Success

   Note on Timelock Testing: While implemented in the contract (TIMELOCK_PERIOD = 3600 seconds), 
   the Remix VM environment's block timestamps advance too quickly between transactions for 
   meaningful timelock testing. This would need to be tested on a real network for accurate results.
